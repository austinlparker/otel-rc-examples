# Practical OpenTelemetry for Web

OpenTelemetry is an Application Programming Interface (API) and Software Development Kit (SDK) for the creation, modification, and export of telemetry data such as metrics, logs, and traces. OpenTelemetry for Go is the reference implementation of the API and SDK, for the Go programming language. This guide is intended to walk you through the fundamental steps of adding OpenTelemetry to an existing client-server application.

This guide assumes a familiarity with the JavaScript programming language and common Linux command-line utilities (such as `curl`). In addition, it assumes you are familiar with the  concepts of OpenTelemetry (if you'd like a refresher, see [the introduction](/README.md#about-opentelemetry)). This guide uses code that can be found in the subfolders of this directory, at different stages, for you to follow along with.
